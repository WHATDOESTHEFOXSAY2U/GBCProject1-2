                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Semantic segmentation, a fundamental challenge in computer vision, seeks to partition an image into coherent segments and subsequently categorize them. This report delves into the adaptation and fine-tuning of HRNet, an avant-garde model tailored for semantic segmentation. Through an exhaustive series of experiments and comparisons, we delineate our discoveries on the model's efficacy across diverse scenarios, including but not limited to precision, adaptability, and computational efficiency.</p>
